      "message": "I wonder whether we can do some sort of automation on disabling this, e.g. with `build-result` triggers [1] that monitor the `validation-docker-manifest-2.0.1` job by polling it (with the current cron setting), but only starting the parent job when the manifest job was not built/failed/unstable and not if it returned success. Just an idea ...\n\n[1] https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/triggers.html",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think it can be done with that plugin. The condition needs to be different for master vs tag jobs. For example:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/p/RnC5k8DcZK/ will create a condition between master jobs and tag jobs. \nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/p/J7tG3BqTn4/ will make the master job to not run daily.\nI need something in between as functionality but the plugin doesn\u0027t allow dynamic conditions.",
