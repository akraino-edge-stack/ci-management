Why not submit a PR directly to the project to make it compatible with Ubuntu? https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/admin/repos/compass4nfv\n\nIf you\u0027re going to continue with this version of the change, I would change the regex you\u0027re searching for just to include the \u003d after host_ip, so that the matching is a bit safer. As is, it would match any variable that was added that starts with \"host_ip\" and has the same indentation.",
