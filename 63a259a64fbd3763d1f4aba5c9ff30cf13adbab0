      "message": "where are you calling this publisher? I\u0027d not hardcode jobs names in the templates since they are like blueprints and doing that reduces reusability. You should pass the object from the prohect section so that you have the flexibility of passing 1 or more jobs lists which need not be `ta-ci-build`.\n\nAlso doing this will trigger the ta-ci-build at the end of every -verify and -merge job?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t have a complete understanding of Jenkins (I was mostly involved in Zuul based projects before January 2019) but I think the logic here makes sense. I believe this will add a new step to the \"Post-build Actions\" section in Jenkins which will be a \"ta-ci-build\" which is exactly what we want.\n\nI think it would be possible to add additional post-build jobs here if we wanted. If there\u0027s really a need to have several different post-build outcomes then it would make sense to split \"ta-publisher-job-merge\" into several differently named publishers.\n\nAs written, I believe this will NOT trigger the ta-ci-build at the end of every -verify job, but WOULD do so if lines 296-299 were added also after line 290. Basically the -verify jobs have on publisher (lf-infra-publish) and the -merge jobs have two publishers (lf-infra-publish and this new trigger-paramerterized-builds)",
