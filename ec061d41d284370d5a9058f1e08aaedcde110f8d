      "message": "I thought some more about this and I\u0027m still not completely sure which way is better: per-pod vs per-label job definition.\nIn theory, having a different set of jobs for each pod is marginally easier to configure, but leads to ever-increasing number of jobs with the addition of new PODs.\nWhat OPNFV and Akraino IEC did was to tie the jobs per-label and create a static (manually updated) mapping structure in the install script.\ne.g. in this case we could do here\n\n  rec_pod:\n    - aarch64_baremetal\n\nand have something like this in ta-install.sh:\n\n  case NODE_NAME in\n    prd-centos7-32c-128g-*)\n      POD_NAME\u003d${NODE_NAME/prd-centos7-32c-128g-/unh-ampere}\n      ;;\n    *)\n      echo Cannot determine LAB/POD name from Jenkins slave name\n      exit 1\n      ;;\n  esac\n\nI personally prefer the per-label approach as it only creates one set of jobs and both approaches will eventually hardcode the label and node name(s) some way or the other.",
